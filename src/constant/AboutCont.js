The reader constantly transmits a rather strong carrier; the tag derives its power and clock from this carrier, kind of like a crystal radio. The tag changes how much carrier it reflects back at the reader—loosely, it makes the circuit across its antenna more like a short or more like an open—to transmit its code. The reader and the tag both have antenna coils tuned to the carrier frequency; they work like a loosely-coupled resonant transformer.`
